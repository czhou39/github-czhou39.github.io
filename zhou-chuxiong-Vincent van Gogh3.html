     <section> <h2> Biography </h2>
     <p> 
         Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on <em>March 30,1853</em> in <b>Groot-Zundert</b>, in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands.
     </p>
     
     <p>
        He was a post-impressionist painter whose work, notable for its beauty, emotion and color, highly influenced 20th-century art. He struggled with mental illness, <br> and remained poor and virtually unknown throughout his life. Van Gogh died in France at age 37 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
     </p>
     
     <p>
        On July 27, 1890, Vincent van Gogh went out to paint in the morning carrying a loaded pistol and shot himself in the chest, but the bullet did not kill him.<br> He was found bleeding in his room. Van Gogh was distraught about his future because, in May of that year, his brother Theo had visited and spoke to him<br> about needing to be stricter with his finances.Van Gogh took that to mean Theo was no longer interested in selling his art.

         <section> <h2> Notable Work </h2>
     <ul>
     <li><h3>The Starry Night</h3></li>

         The Starry Night is an oil on canvas painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,<br> just before sunrise, with the addition of an idealized village.It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941,<br> acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. It is regarded as among Van Gogh's finest works and is one of the most recognized paintings in the history of Western culture.
     <li><h3>Irises</h3></li>

         Irises is one of several paintings of irises by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, and one of a series of paintings he executed at the Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum in<br> Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France, in the last year before his death in 1890.
     <li><h3>Wheat field</h3></li>

         The painting depicts golden fields of ripe wheat, a dark fastigiate Provençal cypress towering like a green obelisk to the right and lighter green olive trees in the<br> middle distance, with hills and mountains visible behind, and white clouds swirling in an azure sky above.
     <li><h3>Wheat field with crows</h3></li>
         
         The Van Gogh Museum's Wheatfield with Crows was painted in July 1890, in the last weeks of van Gogh’s life. Many have claimed it as his last painting,<br> while it is also possible Tree Roots, or the previously mentioned Daubigny's Garden, was his final painting.
